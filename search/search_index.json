Start: Define Objective/Question The process begins with a clear objective or question related to the machine learning task. For example: \"Is model A significantly better than model B?\" \"Does feature X have a significant impact on prediction accuracy?\" 2. Formulate Hypotheses Null Hypothesis (H0): A statement of no effect, no difference, or no relationship. Examples: \"There is no difference in performance between model A and model B.\" \"Feature X has no effect on prediction accuracy.\" Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha): A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. Examples: \"Model A performs significantly better than model B.\" \"Feature X has a significant effect on prediction accuracy.\" 3. Choose Significance Level (\u03b1) The significance level (alpha) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error). Common values are 0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%). 4. Select Appropriate Test Statistic The choice of test statistic depends on the data, the type of comparison, and the assumptions of the test. Examples include: t-test: Comparing means of two groups. ANOVA: Comparing means of multiple groups. Chi-square test: Testing independence of categorical variables. F-statistic: Used in regression analysis. 5. Collect Data/Train Model Collect the necessary data to perform the test. In machine learning, this might involve training models, making predictions, and gathering performance metrics. 6. Calculate Test Statistic Calculate the value of the chosen test statistic based on the collected data. 7. Determine P-value The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. 8. Compare P-value and \u03b1 Compare the calculated p-value to the chosen significance level (\u03b1). 9. Decision: Reject Null Hypothesis (H0) If the p-value is less than or equal to \u03b1, reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is statistically significant evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. 10. Decision: Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis (H0) If the p-value is greater than \u03b1, fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. It does not mean the null hypothesis is true, only that we don't have enough evidence to reject it. 11. Draw Conclusion State the conclusion based on the decision made in the previous step. If H0 is rejected: \"Accept the alternative hypothesis (H1). For example: Model A performs significantly better than Model B\" If H0 is not rejected: \"Fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0). For example: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that Model A performs significantly better than Model B.\" 12. End The process concludes. The results inform decisions about model selection, feature importance, or other aspects of the machine learning problem. This process provides a general framework. The specific details of the hypothesis test will vary depending on the context of the machine learning problem.","title":"Hypothesis Testing in Machine Learning"},{"location":"DAV/Maths/test/#hypothesis-testing-in-machine-learning","text":"Here's a breakdown of how hypothesis testing is applied in machine learning: graph TD A[Start: Define Objective/Question] --> B{Formulate Hypotheses}; B --> C{Choose Significance Level (\u03b1)}; C --> D[Select Appropriate Test Statistic]; D --> E{Collect Data/Train Model}; E --> F[Calculate Test Statistic]; F --> G{Determine P-value}; G --> H{Compare P-value and \u03b1}; H -- p-value \u2264 \u03b1 --> I[Reject Null Hypothesis (H0)]; H -- p-value > \u03b1 --> J[Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis (H0)]; I --> K[Draw Conclusion: Accept Alternative Hypothesis (H1)]; J --> K[Draw Conclusion: Insufficient Evidence to Reject H0]; K --> L[End]; 1.
