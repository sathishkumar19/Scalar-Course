## Hypothesis Testing Flowchart

Here's a simplified flowchart for hypothesis testing:

**Steps**

**Step 1. Define Hypotheses:**

- Null Hypothesis (H0)
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1)


**Step 2. Choose Significance Level (Alpha):**

- e.g., 0.05, 0.01

**Step 3. Select Appropriate Statistical Test:**

- T-test, Z-test, Chi-square, ANOVA, etc.

**Step 4. Collect Sample Data and Compute Test Statistic:**

- Calculate the test statistic (e.g., t, z, chi-square).

**Step 5. Determine P-value or Critical Value:**

- Calculate the p-value OR find the critical value from the distribution table.


**Step 6. Make a Decision:**

- **P-value Approach:**

  - IF p-value < Alpha, THEN Reject H0.
  - ELSE, Fail to Reject H0.

- **Critical Value Approach:**

  - IF test statistic falls in the critical region, THEN Reject H0.
  - ELSE, Fail to Reject H0.


**Step 7. Draw Conclusion:**

- State the conclusion in the context of the problem.


**End**

## Defining Hypotheses

Defining hypotheses involves stating the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** A statement of no effect or no difference. It's what you assume to be true initially.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It's what you're trying to find evidence for.

Example:

- H0: The average height of men is equal to the average height of women.
- H1: The average height of men is different from the average height of women.

Do you have a specific scenario in mind?

## Choosing Significance Level

The significance level (alpha) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error). Common values are 0.05 (5%) and 0.01 (1%).

- Alpha = 0.05 means there's a 5% chance of rejecting H0 when it's true.
- Alpha = 0.01 means there's a 1% chance of rejecting H0 when it's true.

A lower alpha reduces the risk of Type I error but increases the risk of Type II error (failing to reject H0 when it's false).

## Selecting Statistical Test

The appropriate statistical test depends on the type of data and the research question.

- **T-test:** Compares means of two groups.
- **Z-test:** Similar to t-test, used when the population standard deviation is known.
- **Chi-square test:** Examines relationships between categorical variables.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Compares means of three or more groups.
- **Correlation:** Examines the relationship between two continuous variables.
- **Regression:** Predicts the value of one variable based on another.

What kind of data are you working with?

## Interpreting P-values

The p-value is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

- If p-value < alpha, you reject H0. This means the results are statistically significant.
- If p-value >= alpha, you fail to reject H0. This means the results are not statistically significant.

A smaller p-value provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

## Interpreting Critical Values

Critical values are points on the distribution of the test statistic that define the critical region. If the test statistic falls within the critical region, you reject the null hypothesis.

- The critical region is determined by the chosen significance level (alpha).
- You compare the calculated test statistic to the critical value(s).

If the test statistic falls in the rejection region, there is statistically significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
