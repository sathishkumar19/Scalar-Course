    "Understanding Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "Last Updated : 06 Feb, 2025\n",
    "Hypothesis method compares two opposite statements about a population and uses sample data to decide which one is more likely to be correct.To test this assumption we first take a sample from the population and analyze it and use the results of the analysis to decide if the claim is valid or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a company claims that its website gets an average of 50 user visits per day. To verify this we use hypothesis testing to analyze past website traffic data and determine if the claim is accurate. This helps us decide whether the observed data supports the company’s claim or if there is a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Hypotheses\n",
    "Null hypothesis (H0): The null hypothesis is the starting assumption in statistics. It says there is no relationship between groups. For Example A company claims its average production is 50 units per day then here:\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: H₀: The mean number of daily visits (\n",
    "μ\n",
    "μ) = 50.\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis (H1): The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis it suggests there is a difference between groups. like The company’s production is not equal to 50 units per day then the alternative hypothesis would be:\n",
    "H₁: The mean number of daily visits (\n",
    "μ\n",
    "μ) ≠ 50.\n",
    "Key Terms of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "To understand the Hypothesis testing firstly we need to understand the key terms which are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Level of significance: It refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null hypothesis. 100% accuracy is not possible for accepting a hypothesis so we select a level of significance. This is normally denoted with \n",
    "α\n",
    "αand generally it is 0.05 or 5% which means your output should be 95% confident to give a similar kind of result in each sample.\n",
    "P-value: When analyzing data the p-value tells you the likelihood of seeing your result if the null hypothesis is true. If your P-value is less than the chosen significance level then you reject the null hypothesis otherwise accept it.\n",
    "Test Statistic: Test statistic is the number that helps you decide whether your result is significant. It’s calculated from the sample data you collect it could be used to test if a machine learning model performs better than a random guess.\n",
    "Critical value: Critical value is a boundary or threshold that helps you decide if your test statistic is enough to reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "Degrees of freedom: Degrees of freedom are important when we conduct statistical tests they help you understand how much data can vary.\n",
    "Types of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "It involves basically two types of testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypthesis-Testing\n",
    "types of Hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-Tailed Test\n",
    "A one-tailed test is used when we expect a change in only one direction—either an increase or a decrease but not both. Let’s say if we’re analyzing data to see if a new algorithm improves accuracy we would only focus on whether the accuracy goes up not down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test looks at just one side of the data to decide if the result is enough to reject the null hypothesis. If the data falls in the critical region on that side then we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of one-tailed test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Left-Tailed (Left-Sided) Test: If the alternative hypothesis say that the true parameter value is less than the null hypothesis. then it is a Left tailed test. Example: H0​:\n",

    "μ≥50 and H1: \n",

    "50\n",
    "μ>50\n",
    "2. Two-Tailed Test\n",
    "A two-tailed test is used when we want to check for a significant difference in both directions—whether the result is greater than or less than a specific value. We use this test when we don’t have a specific expectation about the direction of change.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are testing whether a new marketing strategy affects sales we want to know if sales increase or decrease so we look at both possibilities.\n",

    "In hypothesis testing Type I and Type II errors are two possible errors that can happen when we are finding conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. These errors are associated with the decisions we made regarding the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "How does Hypothesis Testing work?\n",
    "Working of Hypothesis testing involves various steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "STEPS-IN-HYPOTHESIS-TESTING\n",
    "Steps of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Define Null and Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "We start by defining the null hypothesis (H₀) which represents the assumption that there is no difference. The alternative hypothesis (H₁) suggests there is a difference. These hypotheses should be contradictory to one another. Imagine we want to test if a new recommendation algorithm increases user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀): The new algorithm has no effect on user engagement.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The new algorithm increases user engagement.\n",
    "Note: In this we assume that our data is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2 – Choose significance level\n",
    "Next we choose a significance level (α) commonly set at 0.05. This level defines the threshold for deciding if the results are statistically significant. It also tells us the probability of making a Type I error—rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n",
    "In this step we also calculate the p-value which is used to assess the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Step 3 – Collect and Analyze data.\n",
    "Now we gather data this could come from user observations or an experiment. Once collected we analyze the data using appropriate statistical methods to calculate the test statistic.\n",
    "Example: We collect data on user engagement before and after implementing the algorithm. We can also find the mean engagement scores for each group.\n",
    "Step 4-Calculate Test Statistic\n",
    "The test statistic is a measure used to determine if the sample data support in reject the null hypothesis. The choice of the test statistic depends on the type of hypothesis test being conducted it could be a Z-test, Chi-square, T-test and so on. For our example we are dealing with a t-test because:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a smaller sample size.\n",
    "The population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "T-statistic is a measure of the difference between the means of two groups relative to the variability within each group. It is calculated as the difference between the sample means divided by the standard error of the difference. It is also known as the t-value or t-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5 – Comparing Test Statistic\n",
    "Now we compare the test statistic to either the critical value or the p-value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method A: Using Critical values: We refer to a statistical distribution table like the t-distribution in this case to find the critical value based on the chosen significance level (α). If:\n",
    "\n",
    "If Test Statistic>Critical Value then we Reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "If Test Statistic≤Critical Value then we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Example: If the p-value is 0.03 and α is 0.05 then we reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is smaller than the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Critical values are predetermined threshold values that are used to make a decision in hypothesis testing. To determine critical values for hypothesis testing, we typically refer to a statistical distribution table such as the normal distribution or t-distribution tables based on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Method B: Using P-values: We can also come to an conclusion using the p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (\n",
    "p\n",
    "≤\n",
    "α\n",
    "p≤α) then you reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "If the p-value is greater than the significance level (\n",
    "p\n",
    "≥\n",
    "α\n",
    "p≥α) then you fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Note: To determine p-value for hypothesis testing we typically refer to a statistical distribution table such as the normal distribution or t-distribution tables based on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 7- Interpret the Results\n",
    "Based on the comparison of the test statistic to the critical value or p-value we can conclude whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.\n",

    "Let’s understand hypothesis testing using real life situations. Imagine a pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug that they believe can effectively lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Before bringing the drug to market they need to conduct a study to see its impact on blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Treatment: 120, 122, 118, 130, 125, 128, 115, 121, 123, 119\n",
    "After Treatment: 115, 120, 112, 128, 122, 125, 110, 117, 119, 114\n",
    "Step 1: Define the Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: (H0)The new drug has no effect on blood pressure.\n",
    "Alternate Hypothesis: (H1)The new drug has an effect on blood pressure.\n",
    "Step 2: Define the Significance level\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider the Significance level at 0.05 indicating rejection of the null hypothesis. If the evidence suggests less than a 5% chance of observing the results due to random variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Compute the test statistic\n",

    "Using paired T-test analyze the data to obtain a test statistic and a p-value. The test statistic is calculated based on the differences between blood pressure measurements before and after treatment.\n",

    "Data Quality Dependence: The accuracy of the results depends on the quality of the data. Poor-quality or inaccurate data can led to incorrect conclusions.\n",
    "Missed Patterns: By focusing only on testing specific hypotheses important patterns or relationships in the data might be missed.\n",
    "Context Limitations: It doesn’t always consider the bigger picture which can oversimplify results and led to incomplete insights.\n",
    "Need for Additional Methods: To get a better understanding of the data hypothesis testing should be combined with other analytical methods such as data visualization or machine learning techniques which we study later in upcoming articles.\n",

    "Understanding Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "Understanding Hypothesis Testing- FAQs\n",
    "What is hypothesis testing in data science?\n",
    "In data science, hypothesis testing is used to validate assumptions or claims about data. It helps data scientists determine whether observed patterns are statistically significant or could have occurred by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How does hypothesis testing work in machine learning?\n",
    "In machine learning, hypothesis testing helps assess the effectiveness of models. For example, it can be used to compare the performance of different algorithms or to evaluate whether a new feature significantly improves a model’s accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is hypothesis testing in ML?\n",
    "Statistical method to evaluate the performance and validity of machine learning models. Tests specific hypotheses about model behavior, like whether features influence predictions or if a model generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between Pytest and hypothesis in Python?\n",
    "Pytest purposes general testing framework for Python code while Hypothesis is a Property-based testing framework for Python, focusing on generating test cases based on specified properties of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between hypothesis testing and data mining?\n",
    "Hypothesis testing focuses on evaluating specific claims or hypotheses about a dataset, while data mining involves exploring large datasets to discover patterns, relationships, or insights without predefined hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How is hypothesis generation used in business analytics?\n",
    "In business analytics, hypothesis generation involves formulating assumptions or predictions based on available data. These hypotheses can then be tested using statistical methods to inform decision-making and strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the significance level in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "The significance level, often denoted as alpha (α), is the threshold for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis. Common significance levels are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10, indicating the probability of making a Type I error in statistical hypothesis testing."
